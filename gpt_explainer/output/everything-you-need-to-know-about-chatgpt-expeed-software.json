    "8": "Explanation:\n\nChatGPT Working Process:\n- ChatGPT utilizes a transformer-based neural network architecture to create responses that are consistent and contextually relevant.\n- The model is trained on large datasets of text to understand the statistical patterns of language, including grammar, syntax, and meaning used by humans in communication.\n- When a user interacts through the chat interface, their text input is broken down into numerical vectors for the model to understand.\n- These vectors go through multiple layers of neurons to create a probability distribution function that predicts the next words in the response.\n- The model selects the word with the highest probability to start generating the next word, and this process continues until a complete response is formed.",
    "9": "LLM (Large Language Model) is a type of computer algorithm that is designed to understand and generate human language. When you input text or a question into an LLM, it uses its vast database of language patterns and structures to predict the next word in the sequence. It does this by analyzing the context of the text it has already seen and making an educated guess about what should come next.\n\nImagine you are having a conversation with a friend, and they start a sentence with \"I'm going to the ____.\" Your brain automatically fills in the blank with a logical option like \"store\" or \"park\" based on the context of the conversation. Similarly, an LLM predicts the next word in a sentence by examining the words that have come before it and selecting the most probable continuation.\n\nThis prediction process continues word by word until the LLM completes its answer or generates a full response. LLMs are incredibly powerful tools for tasks like text generation, question answering, and language translation because they can understand and generate human language in a way that mimics our own thought processes.",
    "10": "Neural network explanation: A neural network is a type of software that uses machine learning algorithms to imitate the way a human brain functions. Just like how our brains learn and make decisions based on experiences, a neural network processes data and learns patterns to make predictions or classifications.
